# Long Feedback Submission Test Case

## Test Objective
Verify that feedback submissions with text longer than 400 characters can be successfully submitted without database truncation errors.

## Test Data - Long Positive Feedback

**Store Selection:**
- Store: ST-001 Albany (or any test store)
- Region: North
- Manager: Test User

**Positive Feedback (>400 characters):**
```
Grocery Food up $2134 on LY driven by our pantry and chilled and fresh areas. Big quantity of shares in inventory management and customer service focus. Staff scheduling improvements leading to better coverage during peak hours. Seasonal promotions performing well with strong customer engagement. Stock turns increasing across dairy, frozen, and bakery sections. New product lines showing strong initial performance with positive customer feedback.
```

**Negative Feedback #1 (>400 characters):**
```
Delays in electronic goods deliveries from suppliers causing out-of-stock situations. Several key items missing including popular smartphone models and gaming accessories. Customer complaints about online orders not being fulfilled in promised timeframes. Inventory system updates are not syncing properly between warehouse and floor display units. Need urgent attention from IT team to resolve system integration issues affecting sales.
```

**Negative Feedback #2 (>400 characters):**
```
Apparel fitting room queues are creating bottlenecks during busy periods. Understaffing in the womenswear section during evening shifts is impacting customer service quality. Some floor merchandise needs better organization and visual merchandising refresh. Return rate higher than usual for some fast-fashion items suggesting quality concerns that need vendor discussion. Stockroom organization needs improvement to reduce time spent locating items.
```

**Negative Feedback #3 (>400 characters):**
```
POS system occasionally freezing during peak transaction times causing customer wait delays. Mobile payment options not consistently working across all checkout lanes. Gift card processing errors reported by cashiers requiring manual intervention. Receipt printer jams happening more frequently than normal. Network connectivity issues affecting some payment terminals requiring troubleshooting and maintenance schedule review.
```

**Estimated Impact:**
- Positive Impact: $2,134 (from positive feedback)
- Negative Impact #1: $8,500 (estimated)
- Negative Impact #2: $6,200 (estimated)
- Negative Impact #3: $5,000 (estimated)

**Next Actions (>400 characters):**
```
Immediate actions for next week include: 1) Schedule urgent meeting with IT team to resolve POS system issues and improve network stability, 2) Hire additional part-time staff for evening shifts in apparel section to improve customer service during peak hours, 3) Contact suppliers about delivery timelines and implement backorder communication system for popular electronics, 4) Conduct visual merchandising refresh training for floor team, 5) Review and optimize inventory management processes to reduce stockroom search time.
```

**Freeform Comments (>400 characters):**
```
Additional context: Customer feedback indicates strong performance in grocery staples but need more variety in specialty items. Competitor across the street has launched new loyalty program and we're seeing some customer migration. Local university events are driving traffic but we need better coordination with their event calendar. Weather patterns affecting seasonal merchandise demand requiring flexible ordering strategy. Team morale is good but need to recognize top performers to maintain motivation levels.
```

**Overall Estimated Dollar Impact:** $15,000

## Verification Queries

After submission, verify the data was saved correctly:

```sql
SELECT 
  top_positive,
  top_negative_1,
  top_negative_2,
  top_negative_3,
  next_actions,
  freeform_comments,
  LEN(top_positive) as positive_length,
  LEN(top_negative_1) as negative1_length,
  LEN(top_negative_2) as negative2_length,
  LEN(top_negative_3) as negative3_length,
  LEN(next_actions) as actions_length,
  LEN(freeform_comments) as comments_length,
  created_at,
  id
FROM dbo.store_feedback 
WHERE idempotency_key IN (
  SELECT idempotency_key 
  FROM dbo.store_feedback 
  ORDER BY created_at DESC 
  LIMIT 1
);
```

## Expected Database Values

- `positive_length` should be > 400 (around 500+ chars)
- `negative1_length` should be > 400 (around 500+ chars)
- `negative2_length` should be > 400 (around 500+ chars)
- `negative3_length` should be > 400 (around 500+ chars)
- `actions_length` should be > 400 (around 600+ chars)
- `comments_length` should be > 400 (around 500+ chars)
