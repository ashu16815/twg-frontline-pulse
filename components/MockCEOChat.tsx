Immediate actions needed: supplier escalation, surge labor deployment, and planogram verification.',

    'Which stores need immediate attention?': 'Priority stores: ST-001 Albany (North) - late deliveries, ST-033 Riccarton (South) - POS issues and staffing gaps, ST-027 Dunedin (South) - promo execution delays. All three show negative overall mood and require immediate intervention.',
    'What are the key action items?': 'Critical actions: 1) Supplier escalation for late deliveries (Ops), 2) Roster adjustments for staffing gaps (HR), 3) Overflow planning for bulky stock (Merchandising), 4) POS stability review (IT), 5) Promo execution process tightening (Marketing).'
